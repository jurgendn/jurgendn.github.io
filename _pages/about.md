# Hi there, I'm Jurgen 👋

## About Me

I'm an AI Engineer at **VietinBank**, one of Vietnam's leading commercial banks, where I develop machine learning applications for credit risk optimization, recommendation systems, and financial modeling. I hold a degree in Applied Mathematics and Informatics from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST).

## 🏆 Achievements

- 🥉 **Bronze Medal** - Vietnamese Mathematical Olympiad 2017
- 🏅 **Winner** - Inaugural MLOps Vietnam Marathon 2023
- 📚 **Published Researcher** - WACV 2024, RIVF 2025
- 🦠 **National Impact** - Coordinated COVID-19 epidemic modeling for Vietnam's National Steering Committee
